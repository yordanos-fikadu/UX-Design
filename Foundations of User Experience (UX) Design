User experience: is how a person, the user, feels about interacting with or experiencing a product.
A product is a good, service, or feature. It might be a physical product,
like a video game controller or a bag of potato chips, or a technology product, like an app, website, or smartwatch.

 For a user to have a good experience, the product needs to be 
 - usable:
     making something easy to use This means that the design, structure, and purpose of the product are clear to everyone.
 - equitable: 
    Being equitable means your designs are useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities and backgrounds. 
 - enjoyable
    which creates a positive connection between the user and the product. 
    UX designers foster that positive connection by taking a user's thoughts and feelings into account when making products.
 - useful. 
    meaning they solve our problems. 
important of UX Design

Empathy is the ability to understand someone else's feelings or thoughts in a situation,it is the major portion

Interaction designers
 who focus on designing the experience of a product and how it functions.
 They figure out how to connect the users' needs and the business's goals with what's actually feasible to build. 

Visual designers 
 who focus on how a product or technology looks. They might be responsible for designing logos, illustrations, or icons.

Motion designers
are another common type of UX designer. They think about what it feels like for a user to move through
a product and how to create smooth transitions between pages on an app or a website.

Graphic designers
who create visuals that tell a story or message. Graphic designers usually work on the appearance of a physical product, like an invitation or a poster, 

UX designers 
focus on how users interact with the product.

UX researchers 
conduct the studies or interviews that help us learn how people use a product.

UX writers
who think about how to make the language within a product clearer to make the user experience more intuitive. 
This could include writing labels for buttons or adjusting the tone to be formal or friendly.

Production designers
who often act as a bridge between interaction designers and engineers. 
They make sure the first and final designs match in the finished product materials and that the assets are ready to be handed off to the engineering team. 
assets are everything from text and images to the design specifications, like font style, color, size, and spacing.
Which brings us to the UX engineers, one of the groups that UX designers work with most frequently. 

UX engineers
translate the design's intent into a functioning experience, like a website or an app.

UX program managers
ensure clear and timely communication so that the process of building a useful product moves smoothly from start to finish. 
This might include setting up goals and writing project plans.

UX tools—an overview  
In this certificate, you’ll focus on Figma. Figma is one of the preeminent UX tools. There are other UX tools, mentioned previously, you can look at for comparison. 

Sketch, InVision, and Zeplin
Work well with very large teams that may struggle to adopt new tools

Paired most commonly with another of these tools

Do not require WiFi, enabling offline design work

Do not afford real-time collaboration, prototyping, or design to development collaborative activities

Adobe XD
Works well with teams that already use Adobe’s Suite

Rounds out Adobe’s suite of products with one that is entirely built for digital and UX design work

Syncs to Cloud rather than using actual real-time collaboration and can be used offline

Figma
Is excellent for most designers and contexts

Includes FigJam access, a whiteboard for brainstorming, diagramming, and strategizing

Requires WiFi connection

Is a digital-first, remote-friendly, all-in-one tool, allowing for easier sharing, designing, collaboration,
and reviewing in our ever-changing, more virtual workspace
