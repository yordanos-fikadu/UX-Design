Empathy: is the ability to understand someone else's feelings or thoughts in a situation.
Approaching UX research with empathy makes it easier for you to solve the right problem.
UX designers make a lot of assumptions, but UX design is not about solving problems we assume users want solved. It's about solving problems that users actually want solved.
empathizing with users enhances the products you create because you experience the product as your user does. 

Designing with empathy will enhance the products you create. By building deeper connections with users, you’ll better understand their perspectives and pain points.
Finding that connection early can guide you down the right design path and save you from extensive revisions of your product during a later phase of the design process.

 How to empathize with users
- Ask lots of questions.
  As a UX designer, you cannot make assumptions about the needs of your users. Instead, ask your users directly about their needs and wants,
  which your product design can address. Ask questions that begin with what, how, and why to gain a deeper understanding of your users’ perspective.
- Become more observant.
 Shift your focus to the whole user and not just the words they are using. 
- Be an active listener. 
 Active listening requires you to fully concentrate on, understand, and remember what is being said by the user you’re interacting with. 
- Request input. 
 It’s important that the feedback you receive is objective and unbiased. Friends or colleagues often provide biased, mostly positive feedback because they want to support or please you.
- Have an open mind. 
 We all have biases. Remember, a bias is favoring or having prejudice against something or someone, based on limited information. 
- Keep current on UX research. 
 Follow researchers and join online communities to stay up-to-date on the research that affects UX designers and the users you’re designing for. 

Empathy means understanding someone’s feelings or thoughts, often by feeling the emotions yourself. 
Sympathy is the experience of showing concern or compassion without feeling the emotions themselves. 

  Determine the interview goal
- What do you want to learn from the interviews? 
- Are there certain user problems or pain points that you need to empathize with? 
- Are there any characteristics of users you want to interview? 
- Why? 
- How much information should we have to ensure we get a comprehensive and balanced set of data?
   Write a clear list of goals to explain why you are conducting interviews,

  Interview for research study
- A screener survey or simply screener, for short, is a detailed list of questions that helps researchers determine if potential participants meet 
the requirements of the research study.
- A representative sample is a subset of the target population that seeks to accurately reflect the characteristics of the larger group. 
The participants in a representative sample should include user groups that have been commonly under-represented in previous research.
  Method To get participant 
 - To begin your search, start by creating a list of who you know personally. You can also ask people from your professional circles,
such as your current or former colleagues, managers, or even peers in this course. 
 Once you've compiled a list of people you know, move on to people you don't know. 

- Finding people to interview through your social media profiles.
 - potential interviewees via professional networking sites like LinkedIn. 
 - Online groups based on personal interests are another great resource. 

- third-party research recruiting agency. This means that the agency you hire finds people for you to interview.

- You and your team may also choose to connect with research participants through paid services like usertesting.com or userinterviews.com.

  Ways to prepare for your interview.
- script the interview questions. 
  It's considered a best practice to keep interview questions consistent for every user, so this list of questions will be your guide during the interview. 
- collect supplies you'll need for the interview, 
  such as a printed list of your questions, a computer or paper and a pencil, and any recording equipment you might need. 
- research the users. 
  If the users you're preparing to interview provide their personal information before the interview, be sure to take note of it. 
- practice. 
  It's always a good idea to practice delivering the questions you'll ask users before you conduct a real interview.

 Four steps to conducting user interviews
- meet the participant. 
  - Build a good rapport
    Building good rapport is all about establishing a professional, but friendly, interaction
  - thank the participant for coming.
  - review legal details
  - Gather basic details
  - let the participant know that there are no right or wrong answers
- conducting the interview.
  - Follow interview etiquette.  
     Speak in a clear and concise manner while asking questions.
  - ask open-ended questions
    try asking questions that start with why or what.
    ask follow-up questions based on how the participant answers the initial question
  - Take note
    - highlight compelling quotes. 
      These interesting quotes are great indicators about how users really think and feel. 
    - Document observations about participants. 
      Sometimes what a participant does is equally important as what they say.
      Making notes on their mood, expressions, body language, and behaviors will be important to consider when creating empathy maps. 
    - Consider recording interviews. 
      When you're first learning how to conduct research, recording is ideal.
  - wrap up the interview
    - give users chance to share any final thought
    - always thank the participant again for their time

One way that we can visualize empathy is by creating an empathy map, 
 Empathy map: is an easily-understood chart that explains everything designers have learned about a type of user. 
  An empathy map consists of four squares which show what the user says, does, thinks, and feels.
  The word user goes in the middle right where these squares intersect
 One user empathy maps: where you record feedback from a single user, 
  and aggregated empathy maps, where you consolidate feedback from a group of users. 
 Aggregated empathy: maps represent a visualization of everything designers know about an entire user segment or group of 
similar users, not just one user.

Pain points: are any UX issues that frustrate the user and block the user from getting what they need.
 Types of pain point
- financial: money
- product: quality
- process: path from point to point
- support: any help

 Brain + Heart = UserExperiance

Personas: are fictional users whose goals and characteristics represent the needs of a larger group of users.
 Personas can help us identify patterns of behavior in users. These patterns might point to a common pain point that a group of users experiences. 
A user group is a set of people who have similar interests, goals, or concerns. 
build persona based on research
They help humanize our users
 Benefit of personas
- Build empathy
  stakeholders a clearer idea of who their users really are and makes the user experience more meaningful.
- tell stories
- Stress-test designs
