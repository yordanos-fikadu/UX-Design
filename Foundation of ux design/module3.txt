Design thinking framework involves the following phases:

Empathize
 empathize with people, you try to deeply understand their feelings, thoughts, and experiences on their own terms, without bias or preconceptions. 
design thinking framework involves the following phases: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test.
   powerful methods for empathizing with users as a UX designer:
     Interviews 
      Questionnaires/surveys
      In-person interviews
      Phone interviews
      Video interviews
     Empathy maps
      Who exactly are the users and what are their situations?
      What do users say about their experiences with the product or similar products?
      What do users think about their experiences?
      What do users do before, during, and after their experiences?
      What do users feel about their experiences?
     User personas
         Personas are fictional characters who represent groups of similar users. They help designers distill large amounts of user information into 
           more manageable chunks. 
Define
 designers analyze their empathy work to answer this key question: Which of my users’ needs or problems are the most important ones for my design to address? 
 User stories
 User journeys
 Probleme statment

Ideate, 
 phase is all about getting creative and brainstorming lots of potential solutions. 
 Rapid sketching
 competitive audit 
 Scamper
 Collaboration

Prototype, 
 the goal is not to build a final product. Rather, designers produce early models, or prototypes, of the solution so they can see how it will look and function for users. Prototypes also show stakeholders and potential users what the design can do.
Test.
 Information architecture
 Sitemaps
 Wireframing (paper and digital)
 Lo-fi prototypes
 Hi-fi prototypes 

Business goals typically describe:
 The users they want the design to target
 The outcomes they want the design to achieve
 Their vision for the design’s final look and functionality

Business parameters typically describe:
 The project’s budget, timeline, and scope
 The specific tools and systems that designers must use or design for
 The requirements and standards the design must meet

A design sprint is a time-bound process with five phases typically spread out over five full, eight-hour days.
The goal of design sprints is to solve a critical design challenge through designing, prototyping, and testing ideas with users. 

Design sprints generally include five phases: understand, ideate, decide, prototype, and test.
